# Portfolio

## Coded By: Peter Janasz

## Description
Created a portfolio website with "About Me", "Work", "Resume", and "Contact" sections. Used aside bar to include webpage navigation links to all sections. Created an about me section with a picture of the city my family is from in Krakow, Poland. In the work section I created 5 div section fillers to add future projects to my website. Resume section has a screenshot of resume with link that opens up resume in PDF. Contact section has links to email and phone contact. Added flexbox and media screen to make webpage viewable on multiple screen sizes.
